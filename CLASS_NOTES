-------------------------------------
MainPolymakeObject

The MainPolymakeObject class is the data source for the main document window. It contains the data of one polymake object (loaded from a file or from the database). Its window is controlled by the class PolymakeObjectController.

The class keeps the true polymake object in the variable _rootPerlNode. This points to the perl object given via libpolymake. 

The class stores some meta information on the object:
  - the name of the object (polymake shell equivalent: $p->name)
  - its description (polymake shell equivalent: $p->description)
  - its big object type (polymake shell equivalent: $p->type->name)
  - credits for external software used to compute the properties
  - extensions used (currently not implemented, the polymake data files don't store this information)
  - if the object has been loaded from the database, then we store the database infor tags id, contributor, date, collection, databsase

Its only methods are for loading from a file or from the database
