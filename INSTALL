** Installation instructions for the binary release of PolyViewer **


1) Requirements
 
This application has been built for Mac OS 10.9 and any perpetual beta release of polymake after October 2013.
It will most likely not run on any other Mac OS or with older versions of polymake
 



2) Preparations

2a) libpolymake

    PolyViewer needs the libraries libpolymake.2.12.dylib and libpolymake-app.2.12.dylib.
    They will be found if you installed into /usr/local. Otherwise please do the following:
 
    I) Check if any DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is set in your launchd configuration: In a terminal do

launchctl getenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

        and remember any output.

   II) launchd currently does not read locally defined configuration files (see the launchd man page).

       There are two ways around this nuisance:

       i) If you have sudo rights: Edit (or create, if it is not present) the file /etc/launchd.conf and add

setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH <path>

          where <path> should be the path to the directory containing libpolymake.2.12.dylib.
          If in step 1) you found that DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is already set, then add this to the above!


      ii) If you do not have sudo rights, or you don't want to use them:
     
          a)  in your home folder, do

mkdir ~/.polyviewer
echo "eval \"launchctl setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH <path>\" " > ~/.polyviewer/launchd-setenv
chmod a+x ~/.polyviewer
chmod a+x ~/.polyviewer/launchd-setenv

          where <path> should be the path to the directory containing libpolymake.2.12.dylib.
          If in step 1) you found that DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is already set, then add this to the above!


          ii) Inside the directory ~/Library/LaunchAgents create a file com.github.apaffenholz.PolyViewer.plist 
              and place the folloing lines into it:
        
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
        <key>EnableGlobbing</key>
        <true/>
        <key>Label</key>
        <string>com.github.apaffenholz.PolyViewer</string>
        <key>KeepAlive</key>
        <false/>
         <key>ProgramArguments</key>
        <array>
                <string>sh</string>
                <string>-c</string>
                <string>~/.polyviewer/launchd-setenv</string>
         </array>
        <key>RunAtLoad</key>
        <true/>
    </dict>
</plist>

              Make this file executable with
             
chmod a+x ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.apaffenholz.PolyViewer.plist


  III) In any case you will have to restart your computer to reload the launch 
       demon, or set the variables temporarily by executing

launchctl setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH <path>

       where again <path> should be the path to libpolymake.2.12.dylib. 
       This setting is lost with the next restart.


   IV) If you know of any better way to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for a gui app 
       it would be nice if you tell me!




2b) poly_db

    This step is optional. You only have to so this if you want to use the extension poly_db to
    access the polymake database.

    PolyViewer provides a simple interface to the extension
    "poly_db" of polymake written by Silke Horn (see github) to acces the
    polymake database. To use this you first have to install poly_db and make polymake
    aware of it (for this please follow the instructions on how to install extensions
    at polymake.org, and the special installation instructions that come with poly_db)

    During installation of poly_db for polymake you have been asked to install the
    perl modules MongoDB, boolean, and Tie-IxHash. To use poly_db with PolyViewer you will
    have to add the paths to these modules to the variable PERL5LIB. This is essentially done
    in the same way as above for the path to libpolymake.2.12.dylib.
    
    So find out if any paths are set already with 
    
launchctl getenv PERL5LIB

    Add any output together with an adjusted version of
    
/path/to/MongoDB-<version>/lib:/path/to/boolean-<version>/lib:/path/to/Tie-IxHash-<version>/lib:/path/to/lib/perl5/site_perl/<perl-version>/darwin-thread-multi-2level 

    either to /etc/launchd.conf (remember to put 
    
    setenv PERL5LIB 
    
    in front) or to ~/.polyviewer/launchd-setenv (in this case add
    
    eval "launchctl setenv PERL5LIB

    in front and " at the end).

    Again, this is only read after a restart. Temporarily you could invoke
    
launchctl setenv PERL5LIB <paths>

    where <paths> are the paths used above.



3) Installation

Place the PolyViewer application in your /Application folder



4) Use

Start the viewer by double clicking its icon. Note that it doesn't open a window on statup. Please chose an action from the file menu.



5) Uninstall:

i) Delete the PolyViewer application in /Application

ii) If you have changed the variables DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH or PERL5LIB for launchd during installation set them 
to their original value by calling 

launchctl setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH <original value>

in a terminal (similarly for PERL5LIB). 

Most likely, both variables have been empty originally, in that case do

launchctl unsetenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH 
launchctl unsetenv PERL5LIB
