** Installation instructions for the binary release of PolyViewer **


1) Requirements
 
This application has been built for Mac OS 10.9 and any perpetual beta release of polymake after October 2013.
It will most likely not run on any other Mac OS or with older versions of polymake
 



2) Preparations

2a) libpolymake

PolyViewer needs the libraries libpolymake.2.12.dylib and libpolymake-app.2.12.dylib.
They will be found if you installed into /usr/local. Otherwise please do the following:
 
i) Check if any DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is set in your launchd configuration: In a terminal do

echo export | launchctl

and look for a line starting with DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH. If there is no such line, go to iii)

ii) copy all paths assigned to DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (without quotation marks and semicolons) and
add them toegether with a colon to the front of the path contained in the command in the next step. 
Also write them down somewhere in case you want to reset the variable to its original value.

iii) adjust the path in the following command and issue it in a terminal:

echo setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH /path/to/your/libpolymake/lib | launchctl

where the path should point to the directory containing libpolymake2.12.dylib



2b) poly_db

This step is optional. You only have to so this if you want to use the extension poly_db to
access the polymake database.

PolyViewer provides a simple interface to the extension
"poly_db" of polymake written by Silke Horn (see github) to acces the 
polymake database. To use this you first have to install poly_db and make polymake 
aware of it (for this please follow the instructions on how to install extensions 
at polymake.org, and the special installation instructions that come with poly_db)

During installation of poly_db for polymake you have been asked to install the
perl modules MongoDB, boolean, and Tie-IxHash. To use poly_db with PolyViewer please do
the following: 

i) In a terminal do

echo export | launchctl

and check whether there is a line starting with PERL5LIB. If there is none, please proceed with iii).

ii) Copy all paths following PERL5LIB (without any quotation marks and semicolons)  and
add them toegether with a colon to the front of the path contained in the command in the next step.
Also write them down somewhere in case you want to reset the variable to its original value.

iii) adjust the paths in the following command and issue it in a terminal:

echo setenv PERL5LIB /path/to/MongoDB-<version>/lib:/path/to/boolean-<version>/lib:/path/to/Tie-IxHash-<version>/lib:/path/to/lib/perl5/site_perl/<perl-version>/darwin-thread-multi-2level | launchctl



3) Installation

Place the PolyViewer application in your /Application folder



4) Use

Start the viewer by double clicking its icon. Note that it doesn't open a window on statup. Please chose an action from the file menu.



5) Uninstall:

i) Delete the PolyViewer application in /Application

ii) If you have changed the variables DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH or PERL5LIB for launchd during installation set them 
to their original value by calling 

echo setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH <original value> | launchctl

in a terminal (similarly for PERL5LIB). 

Most likely, both variables have been empty originally, in that case do

echo unsetenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH | launchctl
echo unsetenv PERL5LIB | launchctl
